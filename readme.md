## what is gemini

[gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is an alternative internet protocol to http / https that is really simple

the whole point is that some random guy should be able to code a browser for it

so i decided to be some random guy coding a browser for it

## how to run!?

install pyqt5 (do not do with pip, pip does not work)

go into src/gaming -> python window.py

tabs currently are very buggy, and also the "switching tabs" part of tabs is not finished yet

## current features

* you can load pages
* you can scroll
* there is word wrap
* there is a list of tabs(not fully working)
* there is history

## proposed features

* you will be able to go to websites (no way)
* you will have tabs
* settings to change how websites look (fonts, colors, margins)
* you will be able to click on links
* there will be scrolling
* there will be word wrap
* MAYBE have a way to view images from within the browser -- may or may not do this
